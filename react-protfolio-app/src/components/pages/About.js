        Hello, my name is Javier Martinez. I was born in Tucson, AZ and have lived here my whole life. I originally went to school for Criminal Justice Studies; but have since made a career change to study Web Development and pursue a career in the Web Dev industry. So far I have learned many differnt languages, databases, and libraries to increase my knowledge and better my career as a fullstack web developer. My goals are to continue learning and practicing everything I have learned in class so that I am comfortable applying to jobs in the industry; and to someday pass my knowledge and experiences to other web developers who are starting like me.
