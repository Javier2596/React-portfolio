# REACT Portfolio

## Description

This project is a profile built with React creating a single-page application with sections pertaining to information about me. I built this application to test and show off my skills with ReactJS. My biggest challenges for this application was figuering out how to properly use css in this appilcation, deciding how to organize my application, and rendering a proper image in my portfolio section of the application. This application still needs adjustments to be fully functional.

## Installation

## Usage

The usage of this application is for looking up information on myself and the projects that I have created. It is meant to see my skill level with the react library. Note: (This application is not complete and is still under development).
